# ECommerceSite.github.io

## Final Junior Design Project 

## Design Overview

### Purpose
This project aims to create a fully functional static e-commerce website hosted on GitHub Pages. The primary goal is to provide users with an intuitive and seamless shopping experience while showcasing my artwork available for purchase.

### Original Design Concepts
Initially, I considered various design concepts, focusing on user experience, responsiveness, and aesthetic appeal. The final design incorporates previews of my original pieces in the page layouts, responsive pages to accommodate various sized displays, and an intuitive design to make the site as welcoming and user-friendly as possible. 

Most of the implementation includes the client-side code for interacting and navigating around the site, but basic server-side code has been developed for simulating payment methods, log-in authentication, and submitting requests for custom orders. To do this, the Express framework was used for creating the server-side solution and testing it through locally hosting a server through an open port. Express.js, or simply Express, is a back end web application framework for building RESTful APIs with Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs. It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js 

### Project Justification
The 6-week timeline was justified based on the complexity of implementing custom HTML, CSS and JavaScript, in addition to registering for a domain, ensuring secure encryption handling through HTTPS protocols, and setting up basic back-end code for the server-side solution. 

The motivation for this project is my desire to pursue my passion for art making and further develop my career as an artist after I graduate. I have been making art since I was young, and starting last year I was hired as a student artist at the University Store on Fifth Avenue. While I enjoy being part of the group of student artists at the art den, I wish to advance my skills as a computer engineer by gaining experience in web development while simultaneously focusing on becoming an independent small-business owner. 

## Preliminary Design Verification

### Testing Results
Preliminary testing involved creating all client-side code for the page layouts, deploying the site and ensuring it can be accessed from the published link on GitHub Pages, and verifying basic page functionality via interactive widgets. Results from these tests confirmed the feasibility of the design, ensuring compatibility with different displays and browsers.

Additionally, testing was done for verifying the server-side implementation by following the Express framework to start the local server by running "server.js" from the terminal and testing the following dynamic features of the site: payment gateway, log-in authentication and submitting customization requests. Upon this testing, it was discovered that these dynamic features can be simulated through local hosting, however, a Virtual Private Server needs to eventually be implemented to have these features be fully operational. This item has been added to the backlog of the project to keep subscription costs to a VPS at a minimum. 

### Test Plan
The test plan included launching the site from the link published by GitHub Pages, ensuring responsiveness by opening the site on different sized screen/monitors, navigating through the site pages, and running "server.js" for the server-side code.
